The Saint Petersburg Paradox Game is a Python script that brings a classic probability dilemma to life. In this simulation, a fair coin is tossed until it lands on heads.
The payout increases exponentially with each toss, starting at $2 and doubling each time heads doesn't appear.
Despite the game's infinite expected value, most people hesitate to pay a high fee to play, illustrating the paradox.
This script allows users to input their preferred fee and simulates the game, revealing whether they make a profit or loss based on their choice.
It's an engaging way to explore how economic theories, like this paradox, can be made accessible and enjoyable through interactive programming.
Python's capability to simulate complex scenarios in a straightforward manner showcases how economics can be both informative and entertaining.
